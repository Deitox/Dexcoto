Dexcoto Code License Notice (Proprietary)

Unless expressly stated otherwise, all game source code and content in this repository
that implement the shipped game (including files under `scripts/`, `scenes/`, and
`project.godot`), as well as any game binaries, are proprietary and not open-source.

Your rights to use the game and its content are governed by `EULA.txt` and
`ASSET-LICENSE.md`. The Modding SDK documentation and templates are licensed separately
under MIT (see `LICENSE-SDK.txt`) solely for the purpose of creating mods for Dexcoto.

If you intend to open-source portions of the game in the future, add an explicit
license file covering those parts and reference it from `README.md`.
