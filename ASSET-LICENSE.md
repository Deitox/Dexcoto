# Dexcoto - Asset License

Version 1.0 - [YYYY-MM-DD]

This document covers artwork, audio, fonts, text, cinematics, and other content ("Assets") included with Dexcoto and any official content packs.

---

## 1) Game Assets (shipped with the retail game)
Unless a file is explicitly marked otherwise, all Assets shipped with the retail builds of Dexcoto are:

© Deitox. All rights reserved.

- You may not extract, copy, modify, redistribute, or reuse these Assets outside the Game.
- You may not include these Assets in Mods, derivative games, or any other projects.
- Streaming/capture of gameplay is allowed under the EULA, but does not grant rights to reuse Assets separately.

If you believe an asset is included under a separate third-party license (e.g., a font under SIL OFL), see Section 3 and THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt.

## 2) Official "Dexcoto Mod Content Pack"
We may provide a small set of placeholder materials to help authors prototype Mods (the "Mod Content Pack"). Unless a file within that pack states a different license, the pack is released under the following terms:

Dexcoto Mod Content Pack License (Non-Commercial, Dexcoto-Only)

You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:
- use, modify, and distribute the Pack only as part of Mods for Dexcoto that require a legally obtained copy of the Game; and
- share the Pack within your Mod distributions (e.g., Steam Workshop), provided you include this license text.

You may not:
- use the Pack (or derivatives) in standalone games or other products;
- use the Pack commercially (sell, paywall, etc.) without prior written permission from Deitox;
- use Deitox trademarks or logos; or
- remove or alter copyright notices.

We may update or revoke this license for future versions of the Pack. Your continued use constitutes acceptance of updates.

For commercial permissions, contact: [your email]

## 3) Third-Party Assets
Some Assets (e.g., fonts or SFX) may be governed by their own licenses (e.g., SIL OFL, CC-BY). When that is the case, the specific license file is included alongside the asset and/or listed in THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt. Those third-party licenses control your rights to those specific files.
