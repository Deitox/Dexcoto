# Dexcoto Modding SDK

Welcome! This SDK lets you build and share Mods for Dexcoto - new levels, enemies, items, balance tweaks, skins, and (on PC) optional scripted logic. iOS/console builds are data-driven for platform compliance.

TL;DR
- PC/macOS/Linux: data-driven + optional scripting
- iOS/Consoles: data-driven only (levels/skins/configs; no executable scripts)
- Mods must require Dexcoto and must not be standalone games.
- Licensing: see MODDING_LICENSE.txt. For paid mods, contact us to sign the Commercial Mod Addendum.

Support Matrix
- Data-driven mods: PC Yes, macOS Yes, Linux Yes, iOS Yes, Xbox/PS/Switch Yes (curated)
- Scripted mods (GDScript): PC Yes, macOS Yes, Linux Yes, iOS No, Xbox/PS/Switch No (curated)
- Hot-reload PCK packs: PC Yes, macOS Yes, Linux Yes, iOS Yes, Xbox/PS/Switch Yes (curated)
- Workshop integration: PC Yes, macOS Yes, Linux Yes, iOS No, Xbox/PS/Switch No

Curated = submit to us for review; we may rebundle as DLC-style content where platforms require it.
